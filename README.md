# Num2MC
A very basic command-line tool that converts a desired number of blocks into
how many stacks you would need, and how much would be left over.

To compile it, just clone the repository with
`git clone https://github.com/RosieSapphire/num2mc.git`

Then just type `make`.

If you want to install it to your local bin directory (make it so you can run
it anywhere), then type `sudo make install`, and `sudo make uninstall` if you
decide to remove it.

As for running it, just type `num2mc`, followed by the amount of blocks, so for
example:
`num2mc 420`
would produce
`For 420, you need 6 stacks, with 36 left over.`

That's it.
